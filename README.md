# perspective-occupancy-map
Predict occupancy in perspective view and then project to top view using chandraker's method.

## Side Note
The repository is built keeping pytorch-lightning and wandb for experiment tracking with model, sourcecode and dataset versioning in mind. It can serve as a template for Deeplearning projects in general (better than the vision-dl-template it is forked from).
